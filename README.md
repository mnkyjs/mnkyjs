<h1>Hi. ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm Dennis Hundertmark. I'm a Full Stack developer from Germany.</p>
<p>I currently work as a software developer at an IT service provider. I am also a trainer for upcoming developers.<br>
I worked in different professions, via salesman, office clerk and soldier, until I discovered my passion for programming. ðŸ’š</p>
<p>I love to work with TypeScript and Angular. In my private life, the computer never stands still, because programming is not only my vocation it's more my passion.</p>
